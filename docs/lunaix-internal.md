# Luna's Tour

Welcome to Luna's Tour!

In here you will find documentations, specifications and diagrams that
capture the essence of Lunaix's inner workings. Also the defintions
and explanations about the kernel features mentioned in the huge list 
in the landing page.

Keep in mind that the Lunaix is still on her way to document stuff,
and it is very incompleted, for example the lack of content and no
localisations (all of them are written in Chinese at current stage).

People are encouraged to contribute to the translations.
