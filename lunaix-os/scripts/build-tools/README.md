# Lunaix Build System

The build system used by Lunaix is a hybird approach, with:

+ [LunaConfig](./README.lconfig.md) as compile-time configuration and build parameterisation
+ [LunaBuild](./README.lbuild.md) as soruce file collection and compiler/linker flags setting
+ Makefile for the file dependency check, auto-updating and other top-level managements.
