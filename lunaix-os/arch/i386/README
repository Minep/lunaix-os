Lunaix kernel arch specific ABI
======

This document provides a checklist if one wants to add support for novel architecture

(It is far from complete, as the refactoring is going on)

Implementation checklist:
    [ ] An entry point that recieve control from second stage bootloader.
    [ ] Interrupt vectoring must be done before invoking kernel_bootstrap.
    [ ] Prepare the boot_handoff state struct, according to system info provided
        by upstream bootloader
    [ ] Invoke the kernel_bootstrap, pass the boot_handoff as it's only argument
        This will transfer the control to Lunaix kernel.
    [ ] A syscall handler, syscall table, and the syscall vectoring
    [ ] A interrupt handler, must take care of context save/restore, signal handling
    [ ] A system virtual memory map
    [ ] Implement the following abstractions
